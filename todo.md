# TO-DO list for the current nixos config.

There are TODOs scattered around the .nix files. Here I'm going to write general goals.

## Critical, must be done
These are things that I either need for the computer to work properly or to get work done.
- `(+)` Display server / hyprland
- `(+)` Application launcher (rofi)
- `(+)` Text editor
- `(+)` Browser
- `(+)` Terminal emulator
- `(+)` Version control (git) for the config files, in case I fuck something up
- `(+)` Jupyter notebook (for uni)
- `(-)` LaTeX environment
- `(-)` Haskell environment

## Good to have
Things that aren't strictly neccesary, but are nice to have.
- `(+)` Screenshot utility
- `(+)` Steam
- `(+)` Flatpak
- `(+)` Discord
- `(-)` Prism Launcher
- `(+)` Lock screen utility
- `(+)` Shutdown menu on waybar
- `(+)` Functioning idris2 environment
- `(-)` Working screenshare (E.G on discord)
- `(-)` Fix mako not picking up discord notifications. Check that it works for other notifs. too.
- `(-)` Music player. Perhaps move (and organize) downloaded music from my phone. It would be nice if it worked with spotify or something too.
- `(-)` Bluetooth support.

## Customizations and preferences

- `(+)` Rofi
- `(+)` Waybar
- `(+)` Color scheme modules
- `(+)` Move hyprland config to home-manager

- `(-)` Rice hyprlock
